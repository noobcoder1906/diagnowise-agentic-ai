Here is a step-by-step guide for providing first aid for a nosebleed:

1. **Stay Calm**: Encourage the person with the nosebleed to stay calm, as anxiety can increase blood pressure and worsen the bleeding.

2. **Positioning**: Ask the person to sit upright and lean slightly forward. This helps prevent blood from running down the back of the throat.

3. **Pinch the Nose**: Instruct the person to pinch their nose just above the nostrils with their index finger and thumb. This applies pressure to the area where the bleeding is occurring.

4. **Breathing**: Remind the individual to breathe through their mouth while pinching their nose.

5. **Timing**: Keep the nostrils pinched for 10 to 15 minutes. Do not release the pinch to check if the bleeding has stopped, as this can disrupt the clotting process.

6. **After Care**: Once the bleeding has stopped, advise the person to avoid blowing their nose or straining for several hours as this may trigger further bleeding.

7. **When to Seek Help**: Seek professional medical help if:
   - The bleeding continues after 20 minutes of applying pressure.
   - The nosebleed was caused by a head injury or is accompanied by severe symptoms (dizziness, fainting, or feeling unwell).
   - Blood is spurting from the nostril.
   - The individual turns pale, becomes sleepy, or falls unconscious.

8. **Hygiene**: After providing care, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based sanitizer if soap is not available.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage a nosebleed and ensure that your friend receives the care they need.
